This repository contains a MATLAB code example demonstrating an uncommon error scenario: division by zero and negative input handling. The `bug.m` file shows the initial code with potential errors. The `bugSolution.m` file demonstrates improved error handling and robust solution.  The errors are related to cases when a user might inadvertently input a negative value or a value that leads to division by zero. The solutions focus on preventing unexpected crashes and providing informative error messages.
